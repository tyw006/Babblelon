# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

BabbleOn is a voice-driven Thai language learning mobile game built with Flutter and Flame engine. Players explore Bangkok's Yaowarat (Chinatown) district at night, practicing Thai through conversations with AI-powered NPCs. The game combines 2D side-scrolling gameplay with speech recognition, AI-generated dialogue, and text-to-speech technology.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Flutter 3.2.0+ with Flame game engine, Riverpod state management, Isar local database
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) with multiple AI service integrations
- **AI Services**: OpenAI GPT-4o/Google Gemini (LLM), Azure Speech (STT), ElevenLabs/Google TTS, Google Translate
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with pgvector for embeddings)

## Essential Development Commands

### Flutter/Mobile App
```bash
# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run the app (requires .env file with Supabase credentials)
flutter run

# Run tests
flutter test

# Build and analyze (use before committing)
flutter analyze
flutter build

# Generate code (for Riverpod providers and Isar models)
dart run build_runner build
```

### Backend API
```bash
# Run FastAPI server (from backend/ directory)
uv run main.py

# Test individual AI services
uv run test_files/test_openai_llm.py
uv run test_files/test_elevenlabs_stt.py
uv run test_pronunciation_api.py

# Run any Python files or tests in backend
uv run <filename.py>
```

**Note**: This project uses `uv` for Python environment management. Always use `uv run` to execute Python files in the backend directory.

### Environment Setup
- Create `.env` file in root with `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- Backend API keys configured in FastAPI service classes

## Architecture Overview

### Core Game Loop
```
Player Speech → STT (Azure) → LLM Processing (GPT-4o/Gemini) → TTS (ElevenLabs) → NPC Response
```

### Key Directories
- `lib/game/`: Flame engine components (player, NPCs, collision detection, camera)
- `lib/screens/`: Flutter UI screens (menu, game interface, boss fights)
- `lib/providers/`: Riverpod state management for game state, user data, AI services
- `lib/services/`: API integrations and external service wrappers
- `backend/services/`: Python AI service implementations
- `assets/data/`: Game vocabulary, NPC dialogue data, quest definitions

### State Management Pattern
- Uses Riverpod with code generation (`@riverpod` annotations)
- Game state managed through providers in `lib/providers/`
- Local persistence via Isar database for offline functionality
- Supabase integration for user data and premium features

### Game Architecture
- `BabbleLonGame` class extends FlameGame with collision detection
- Component-based entities (Player, NPCs, Portals, Speech bubbles)
- Quest system with vocabulary tracking and spaced repetition
- NPC charm system with facial expressions based on conversation quality

## Boss Fight System

### Combat Mechanics
- **Turn-based combat** alternating between player and boss turns
- **Health system**: Player (100 HP), Boss (500 HP for Tuk-Tuk Monster)
- **Pronunciation-based combat**: Attack/defend by correctly pronouncing Thai vocabulary
- **Equipment requirements**: Players must collect attack/defense items from NPCs before accessing boss fights
- **Portal access**: Boss fights accessed through portal components after meeting item requirements

### Damage Calculation
- **Complex scoring system** incorporating pronunciation accuracy, word complexity, equipped items
- **Critical hits and great defense** thresholds with visual feedback
- **Assessment integration**: Azure Speech pronunciation API provides detailed scoring
- **Real-time feedback**: Word-by-word analysis with error identification

### Boss Types
- **Tuk-Tuk Monster**: Primary boss with custom sprites, background, and audio
- **Rich animations**: Attack/defense animations, projectile effects, damage indicators
- **Audio integration**: Boss-specific background music and sound effects

### Battle Analytics
- **Performance tracking**: Turn efficiency, pronunciation scores, vocabulary mastery
- **Post-battle analysis**: Detailed performance grades (S, A, B, C) and improvement areas
- **Progress saving**: Vocabulary words with 60+ pronunciation score marked as mastered

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style (from .cursor/rules/)
- **Naming Conventions**: PascalCase for classes, camelCase for variables/functions, underscores_case for file/directory names
- **Type Safety**: Always declare types, avoid `any`, create necessary types when needed
- **Function Design**: Write short functions (<20 instructions) with single purpose, start function names with verbs
- **Boolean Variables**: Use verbs for boolean variables (isLoading, hasError, canDelete)
- **Constants**: Use UPPERCASE for environment variables, avoid magic numbers

### Flutter-Specific Best Practices
- **Architecture**: Use clean architecture with repository pattern, controller pattern with Riverpod
- **State Management**: Use Riverpod with `@riverpod` annotations and code generation
- **Widget Design**: 
  - Break down complex widgets to avoid deep nesting
  - Use `const` constructors wherever possible to reduce rebuilds
  - Create reusable components for better code organization
- **Data Management**: 
  - Repository pattern for data persistence (Isar local, Supabase cloud)
  - Use immutable data structures where possible
  - Avoid data validation in functions, use classes with internal validation

### Code Organization
- **File Structure**: One export per file, use extensions for reusable code
- **Functions**: Use higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce) to avoid nesting
- **Error Handling**: Use exceptions for unexpected errors, add context when catching
- **Dependencies**: Use getIt for dependency injection (singleton for services/repositories)

### Project-Specific Requirements
- **Environment Setup**: Always verify `.env` file exists with required Supabase credentials
- **Code Generation**: Run `dart run build_runner build` after changes to Riverpod providers or Isar models  
- **Verification**: Always run `flutter analyze` and `flutter build` before committing
- **Scan Before Creating**: Check existing files before creating new ones to avoid duplication

### Testing Strategy
- Widget tests for UI components (`flutter test`)
- Integration tests for AI service modules
- Backend API testing via test files in `backend/test_files/`

### Build Verification
**CRITICAL RULE**: Always run `flutter build` after ANY changes to the application code to ensure it can build properly.

Always run before committing:
1. `flutter analyze` - Check for lint issues
2. `flutter build` - Verify build passes (MANDATORY after any code changes)
3. `dart run build_runner build` - Regenerate generated code if needed

### Navigation Flow
**Current Flow**: Main Menu → Game Screen (with background initialization)
**Previous Issue**: Main Menu → Loading Screen → Game Screen (redundant loading, potential hangs)

**Fix Applied**: Removed blocking loading screen and moved ML Kit initialization to background process that doesn't block gameplay. Game can function even if character tracing initialization fails.

## AI Service Integration

### Backend Services (`backend/services/`)
- `llm_service.py`: GPT-4o and Gemini integration for NPC dialogue
- `stt_service.py`: Azure Speech-to-Text for player input
- `tts_service.py`: ElevenLabs and Google TTS for NPC responses
- `pronunciation_service.py`: Azure pronunciation assessment
- `translation_service.py`: Google Translate with Thai romanization

### Frontend Integration (`lib/services/`)
- HTTP API calls to FastAPI backend
- Audio recording and playback via flutter_sound/audioplayers
- Real-time speech processing pipeline

## Multi-Language Design Requirements

### Language Agnostic Architecture
- **Target**: Code must be generalizable to support ANY language, not just Thai
- **Focus**: Asian languages (Vietnamese, Chinese, Japanese, Korean) as primary targets
- **Implementation**: Use configuration-driven approach with language parameters
- **Existing Support**: Backend already supports multiple languages via `LANGUAGE_CONFIGS` in `translation_service.py`

### Extension Over Creation Rules
- **CRITICAL RULE**: Always extend existing services/files instead of creating new separate files
- **BACKEND SCANNING REQUIREMENT**: Before implementing new logic, scan the `backend/` directory to identify existing functions and services that can be extended
- **Pattern**: Look for existing functions that can be enhanced with new parameters
- **Examples**: 
  - Extend `translation_service.py` for new language features
  - Extend existing UI components with new capabilities  
  - Add parameters to existing providers instead of creating new ones
- **Implementation Process**:
  1. Scan backend directory for existing related functionality
  2. Check services like `translation_service.py`, `llm_service.py`, etc.
  3. Identify existing endpoints in `main.py`
  4. Extend existing functions rather than creating new ones
- **Verification**: Check existing codebase thoroughly before creating any new files

## Recent Development Focus

Based on recent commits, active development includes:
- Boss fight system implementation and refinement
- Enhanced vocabulary management with audio integration
- Pronunciation assessment integration with combat mechanics
- UI/UX improvements with damage indicators and animations
- Audio management system with echo effects and sound feedback
- NPC dialogue system with charm mechanics and special item interactions
- **NEW**: Thai word learning and character tracing feature development

## Character Tracing & Item Giving Feature Requirements

### Interactive Translation System
- **Dual-Tab Design**: Translation dialog should have two tabs:
  1. **Pure Translation Tab**: Traditional English-to-target language translation
  2. **Item Giving/Drawing Tab**: Character tracing for giving virtual items to NPCs
- **Custom Pipeline**: Item giving bypasses STT, sends "User gives {ITEM} to you" directly to LLM, then follows normal TTS response
- **UI Enhancement**: Use Lottie animations and engaging visual elements for interactive character tracing

### Vocabulary Mastery Integration
- **Existing System**: Integrate with current `MasteredPhrase` Isar database model
- **Mastery Threshold**: Characters drawn with 60+ accuracy should contribute to vocabulary mastery
- **Progress Tracking**: Track character tracing proficiency alongside pronunciation scores
- **Database Extension**: Extend `MasteredPhrase` model to include character tracing metrics

### Animation and Visual Design
- **Lottie Integration**: Use Lottie animation library for engaging UI interactions
- **Interactive Elements**: Animated feedback for successful character completion
- **Visual Engagement**: Drawing canvas with smooth animations and visual rewards
- **Performance**: Lightweight vector-based animations for optimal mobile performance

### Character Validation System
- **ML Kit Digital Ink Recognition**: Use Google ML Kit for character recognition with confidence scores
- **Direct Character Matching**: Compare recognized text to expected Thai character for validation
- **Confidence-Based Scoring**: Use ML Kit confidence scores for accuracy assessment (aim for 0.8+ confidence)
- **Language Model Download**: Ensure Thai language package is downloaded before character tracing features
- **No Stroke Order Enforcement**: Focus on character recognition rather than traditional stroke order validation
- **Thai Writing Guidance**: Provide cultural writing tips (circles first, vowel placement) instead of strict stroke sequences

## Recent Character Tracing Implementation Summary

### Implementation Session Overview
**Date**: 2025-06-29  
**Feature**: Thai Character Tracing UI Fixes and Enhancements  
**Primary Goal**: Fix multiple UI issues in the character tracing dialog based on user feedback

### Issues Addressed

#### 1. Real-time Stroke Preview Not Visible
**Problem**: Users couldn't see their drawing strokes in real-time while tracing characters  
**Root Cause**: `_InkPainter` class wasn't rendering current stroke points during drawing  
**Solution**: Enhanced `_InkPainter` class to accept and render `currentStrokePoints` parameter
```dart
class _InkPainter extends CustomPainter {
  final mlkit.Ink ink;
  final List<mlkit.StrokePoint> currentStrokePoints; // Added this field

  _InkPainter(this.ink, {this.currentStrokePoints = const []});

  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    // Draw all completed strokes (existing code)
    // ...

    // NEW: Draw current stroke being drawn (real-time preview)
    if (currentStrokePoints.isNotEmpty) {
      final Paint currentPaint = Paint()
        ..color = const Color(0xFF4ECCA3).withValues(alpha: 0.8)
        ..strokeCap = StrokeCap.round
        ..strokeWidth = 4.0
        ..style = PaintingStyle.stroke;

      final Path currentPath = Path();
      bool first = true;
      
      for (final mlkit.StrokePoint point in currentStrokePoints) {
        if (first) {
          currentPath.moveTo(point.x, point.y);
          first = false;
        } else {
          currentPath.lineTo(point.x, point.y);
        }
      }
      
      canvas.drawPath(currentPath, currentPaint);
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Remove "Give Item" Button from Custom Translation Flow
**Problem**: Translation dialog showed both "Translate" and "Give Item" buttons inappropriately  
**Solution**: Modified button logic to show only "Trace Character" button in custom translation flow
```dart
// OLD: Both buttons showing
if (_translationMappingsNotifier.value.isNotEmpty) {
  _buildTranslateButton(context, 'th'),
  if (_hasDrawableItems()) _buildGiveItemButton(context, 'th'),
}

// NEW: Only trace character button
if (_translationMappingsNotifier.value.isNotEmpty) {
  _buildTraceCharacterButton(context, 'th'),
}
```

#### 3. Audio Playback Integration
**Problem**: No audio playback for vocabulary words that had audio files  
**Solution**: Added sound icon and playback functionality for vocabulary items with `audio_path`
```dart
// Added audio icon with tap handler
if (itemData['audio_path'] != null && itemData['audio_path'].toString().isNotEmpty) ...[
  const SizedBox(width: 8),
  GestureDetector(
    onTap: () => _playVocabularyAudio(itemData['audio_path']),
    child: Container(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(6),
      decoration: BoxDecoration(
        color: const Color(0xFF4ECCA3).withValues(alpha: 0.2),
        borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(12),
      ),
      child: const Icon(Icons.volume_up, color: Color(0xFF4ECCA3), size: 20),
    ),
  ),
],
```

#### 4. Enhanced PyThaiNLP Integration
**Problem**: Basic character tips without linguistic analysis  
**Solution**: Integrated PyThaiNLP `analyze_character_components` function for detailed character analysis
```dart
// Enhanced tip building with PyThaiNLP data
String _buildTipsFromAnalysis(String character, Map<String, dynamic> analysis) {
  final List<String> sections = [];
  
  if (analysis['breakdown'] != null) {
    final consonants = analysis['consonants'] as List? ?? [];
    final vowels = analysis['vowels'] as List? ?? [];
    final toneMarks = analysis['tone_marks'] as List? ?? [];
    
    // Build detailed analysis sections...
  }
}
```

#### 5. UI Updates and Consistency
**Problem**: Outdated UI labels and inconsistent theming  
**Solutions**:
- Changed "Translate to Thai" → "Language Tools"
- Replaced translate icon with language icon (`Icons.language`)
- Applied consistent app theme colors throughout
- Verified NPC-specific vocabulary loading works correctly

#### 6. Bottom Instruction Widget Removal
**Problem**: Redundant "trace the character with your finger" widget at bottom  
**Solution**: Removed bottom widget and added transparent overlay instruction at top of tracing area
```dart
// Added transparent instruction overlay
Positioned(
  top: 8,
  left: 8,
  right: 8,
  child: Container(
    padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 12, vertical: 6),
    decoration: BoxDecoration(
      color: Colors.black.withValues(alpha: 0.4),
      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20),
    ),
    child: Text(
      'Trace the character with your finger',
      textAlign: TextAlign.center,
      style: TextStyle(
        fontSize: 12,
        color: Colors.white.withValues(alpha: 0.9),
        fontWeight: FontWeight.w500,
      ),
    ),
  ),
),
```

#### 7. Character Navigation Fix
**Problem**: Horizontal scrollbar for character navigation wasn't functional  
**Root Cause**: Mismatched PageController references with ListView implementation  
**Solution**: Removed PageController logic and simplified navigation
```dart
// OLD: PageController approach (broken)
PageController _characterPageController = PageController();

// NEW: Simple state-based navigation
void _nextCharacter() {
  if (_currentCharacterIndex < _currentWordMapping.length - 1) {
    setState(() {
      _currentCharacterIndex++;
    });
    _clearCanvas();
    _updateTracingArea();
  }
}
```

#### 8. Back Button Navigation Fix
**Problem**: Back button closed popup instead of returning to language tools  
**Solution**: Updated back button to navigate to language tools dialog
```dart
IconButton(
  onPressed: () {
    Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Close character tracing
    // Show language tools dialog
    _showEnglishToTargetLanguageTranslationDialog(context, targetLanguage: 'th');
  },
  icon: const Icon(Icons.arrow_back, size: 24, color: Colors.white),
  tooltip: 'Back to language tools',
),
```

#### 9. Writing Tips Improvements
**Problem**: Emojis in writing tips and RenderFlex overflow errors  
**Solutions**:
- Removed all emojis from PyThaiNLP analysis display
- Made writing tips scrollable with fixed height container
- Clean text formatting with bullet points

```dart
// Before: Emoji-heavy format
sections.add('📝 Character Analysis');
sections.add('🌱 Complexity: BEGINNER');
sections.add('🔤 Consonants (1)');

// After: Clean text format
sections.add('Character Analysis');
sections.add('Complexity: BEGINNER');
sections.add('Consonants (1)');

// Made scrollable with fixed height
child: SizedBox(
  height: 300, // Set max height for scrollable area
  child: SingleChildScrollView(
    child: Column(
      // ... writing tips content
    ),
  ),
),
```

## Game Initialization & Character Tracing UI Improvements - Phase 5

### Implementation Session Overview
**Date**: 2025-06-30  
**Feature**: Game Initialization Service and Character Tracing UI Enhancements  
**Primary Goal**: Implement preloading system and improve character tracing UX based on user feedback

### Phase 1: Game Initialization Service

#### 1. GameInitializationService Implementation
**Purpose**: Preload ML Kit models and NPC vocabulary to eliminate gameplay lag  
**Location**: `/Users/timwang/Projects/babblelon/lib/services/game_initialization_service.dart`

**Key Features**:
- **ML Kit Model Preloading**: Downloads Thai character recognition model during initialization
- **NPC Vocabulary Caching**: Preloads all NPC vocabulary JSON files into memory
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates with percentage and step descriptions
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with retry functionality
- **Singleton Pattern**: Single instance ensures consistent state across app

```dart
/// Initialize all game assets and models
Future<bool> initializeGame({
  Function(double progress, String step)? onProgress,
}) async {
  // Step 1: Initialize ML Kit model manager (10% progress)
  await _initializeMLKitManager();
  
  // Step 2: Download Thai ML Kit model (40% progress)
  await _downloadThaiMLKitModel();
  
  // Step 3: Preload NPC vocabulary data (70% progress)
  await _preloadNPCVocabulary();
  
  // Step 4: Finalization (100% progress)
  _isInitialized = true;
  return true;
}
```

#### 2. Loading Screen Implementation
**Purpose**: Provide visual feedback during initialization process  
**Location**: `/Users/timwang/Projects/babblelon/lib/screens/loading_screen.dart`

**Key Features**:
- **Animated Progress Bar**: Real-time progress visualization
- **Lottie Animations**: Loading spinner with smooth animations
- **Error Handling**: Retry functionality with error messages
- **Smooth Transitions**: Fade transition to game screen upon completion

```dart
final success = await initService.initializeGame(
  onProgress: (progress, step) {
    setState(() {
      _progress = progress;
      _currentStep = step;
    });
    _progressController.animateTo(progress);
  },
);
```

#### 3. Navigation Flow Updates
**Updated Flow**: Main Menu → Loading Screen → Game Screen  
**Previous Flow**: Main Menu → Game Screen (with lag during gameplay)

### Phase 2: Character Tracing UI Improvements

#### 1. Undo Button Repositioning
**Problem**: Undo button was in bottom center, clearing entire canvas  
**Solution**: Moved to bottom-right corner with stroke-by-stroke undo functionality

```dart
Widget _buildFloatingUndoButton() {
  return Container(
    width: 56,
    height: 56,
    decoration: BoxDecoration(
      color: Colors.orange[600],
      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(28),
      boxShadow: [BoxShadow(...)],
    ),
    child: InkWell(
      onTap: _ink.strokes.isNotEmpty ? _undoLastStroke : null,
      child: Icon(Icons.undo, size: 28),
    ),
  );
}

void _undoLastStroke() {
  if (_ink.strokes.isNotEmpty) {
    setState(() {
      _ink.strokes.removeLast();
      _strokeHistory.clear();
      _strokeHistory.addAll(_ink.strokes);
    });
  }
}
```

#### 2. Touch Detection Widget Removal
**Problem**: Redundant "Touch Detection: Ready" widget cluttering interface  
**Solution**: Completely removed debug status display, replaced with helpful UI elements

#### 3. Back Button Consolidation
**Problem**: Two back buttons (top-left and bottom-left) causing confusion  
**Solution**: Removed top-left back button, kept only bottom-left for navigation

```dart
// REMOVED: Top-left back button from header
// KEPT: Bottom-left back button for navigation
Widget _buildBottomButton() {
  return Container(
    child: Row(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween,
      children: [
        _buildActionButton(icon: Icons.arrow_back, onPressed: widget.onBack),
        _buildActionButton(icon: Icons.check, onPressed: widget.onComplete),
      ],
    ),
  );
}
```

#### 4. Writing Tips Tooltip Implementation
**Problem**: Writing tips panel taking up valuable screen space  
**Solution**: Converted to tap-triggered tooltip with organized sections

```dart
Widget _buildWritingTipsTooltip() {
  return GestureDetector(
    onTap: () => _showWritingTipsDialog(),
    child: Container(
      width: 40,
      height: 40,
      decoration: BoxDecoration(
        color: const Color(0xFF4ECCA3).withValues(alpha: 0.9),
        borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20),
      ),
      child: const Icon(Icons.help_outline, size: 22),
    ),
  );
}

void _showWritingTipsDialog() {
  showDialog(
    context: context,
    builder: (context) => Dialog(
      child: Container(
        constraints: const BoxConstraints(maxWidth: 400, maxHeight: 500),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            // Writing tips with organized sections for vowels/consonants/tones
            Text(_writingTips, style: TextStyle(height: 1.5)),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

#### 5. Header Size Optimization
**Problem**: Header taking too much vertical space  
**Solution**: Reduced header size with inset appearance and smaller fonts

```dart
Widget _buildHeader(Map<String, dynamic> wordData) {
  return Container(
    margin: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 16, vertical: 8),
    padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 16, vertical: 10),
    decoration: BoxDecoration(
      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(12),
      boxShadow: [BoxShadow(...)], // Inset appearance
    ),
    child: Column(
      children: [
        Text(
          wordData['thai'] ?? '',
          style: const TextStyle(fontSize: 22), // Reduced from 28
        ),
        Text(
          '${wordData["translation"]} (${wordData["transliteration"]})',
          style: const TextStyle(fontSize: 14), // Reduced from 16
        ),
      ],
    ),
  );
}
```

#### 6. Drawing Area Expansion
**Problem**: Limited drawing space due to UI elements  
**Solution**: Optimized layout to maximize drawing area

```dart
// Main tracing area (expanded from flex: 4 to flex: 5)
Expanded(
  flex: 5,
  child: _buildTracingOnly(currentCharacter),
),
```

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Stroke Management Enhancement
```dart
// Added stroke history for undo functionality
final List<mlkit.Stroke> _strokeHistory = [];

void _onPanEnd(DragEndDetails details) {
  if (_currentStroke != null) {
    if (!_ink.strokes.contains(_currentStroke!)) {
      _ink.strokes.add(_currentStroke!);
      _strokeHistory.add(_currentStroke!); // Track for undo
    }
    // Clear current stroke
    _currentStroke = null;
    _currentStrokePoints.clear();
    setState(() {});
  }
}
```

#### UI Layout Optimization
- **Header**: Reduced from 32px total padding to 20px
- **Font Sizes**: Thai text reduced from 28px to 22px, subtitle from 16px to 14px
- **Drawing Area**: Increased from flex: 4 to flex: 5 (25% more space)
- **Margins**: Optimized margins and padding throughout for better space utilization

### Performance Improvements

#### 1. Preloading Benefits
- **ML Kit Model**: Downloaded once during initialization vs. on-demand
- **NPC Vocabulary**: Cached in memory vs. file system reads during gameplay
- **Estimated Improvement**: 2-3 second reduction in first character tracing interaction

#### 2. UI Responsiveness
- **Undo Button**: Instant visual feedback with disabled state when no strokes
- **Tooltip**: Non-blocking modal dialog vs. always-visible panel
- **Header**: Reduced rendering complexity with smaller components

### Files Modified

#### New Files Created
- **`/lib/services/game_initialization_service.dart`**: Centralized initialization service
- **`/lib/screens/loading_screen.dart`**: Loading screen with progress feedback

#### Updated Files
- **`/lib/screens/main_menu_screen.dart`**: Updated navigation to use loading screen
- **`/lib/widgets/character_tracing_widget.dart`**: Complete UI overhaul with new features
- **`/lib/widgets/character_tracing_test_widget.dart`**: Uses shared component (no changes needed)

### Quality Assurance

#### Code Analysis Results

## Recent Character Tracing Implementation Summary - Phase 2

### Implementation Session Overview
**Date**: 2025-06-29  
**Feature**: Thai Character Tracing Navigation and Rendering Improvements  
**Primary Goal**: Fix critical navigation and rendering issues based on user feedback from Phase 1

### Issues Addressed

#### 1. Redundant "Ready" Status Indicator Removal
**Problem**: Light grey box in top-right corner showing "Ready/Loading model..." was redundant with instruction overlay  
**Root Cause**: Multiple status indicators providing same information  
**Solution**: Completely removed the top-right status container
```dart
// REMOVED: Entire top-right status container (lines 2640-2677)
Positioned(
  top: 8,
  right: 8,
  child: Container(
    // ... "Ready" status display removed
  ),
),
```

#### 2. Navigation Without Canvas Interaction
**Problem**: Users could only navigate between words by interacting with the drawing canvas  
**Root Cause**: PageView implementation required touch interaction to change pages  
**Solution**: Replaced PageView with horizontal ScrollController + visible Scrollbar
```dart
// NEW: Horizontal scrollable navigation
Scrollbar(
  controller: _wordTracingScrollController,
  thumbVisibility: true,
  trackVisibility: true,
  thickness: 8.0,
  child: SingleChildScrollView(
    controller: _wordTracingScrollController,
    scrollDirection: Axis.horizontal,
    child: Row(
      children: _currentWordMapping.asMap().entries.map((entry) {
        // Individual word containers with tap-to-select
        return GestureDetector(
          onTap: () {
            setState(() { _currentCharacterIndex = index; });
            _clearCanvas();
            _updateTracingArea();
            SchedulerBinding.instance.scheduleFrame();
          },
          child: Container(/* word display */),
        );
      }).toList(),
    ),
  ),
),
```

#### 3. Canvas Immediate Rendering Fix
**Problem**: Canvas strokes only appeared after navigating away and returning  
**Root Cause**: PageView + CustomPaint lifecycle conflicts causing paint layer delays  
**Solution**: Applied three-part fix for immediate rendering
```dart
// 1. RepaintBoundary for paint isolation
RepaintBoundary(
  child: GestureDetector(
    onPanStart: _onPanStart,
    onPanUpdate: _onPanUpdate,
    onPanEnd: _onPanEnd,
    child: CustomPaint(
      key: ValueKey('word_ink_canvas_${_ink.strokes.length}_${_currentStrokePoints.length}'),
      painter: _InkPainter(_ink, currentStrokePoints: _currentStrokePoints),
      size: Size.infinite,
    ),
  ),
),

// 2. Forced frame scheduling on word change
SchedulerBinding.instance.scheduleFrame();

// 3. Enhanced shouldRepaint logic
@override
bool shouldRepaint(covariant _InkPainter oldDelegate) {
  if (currentStrokePoints.isNotEmpty) return true;
  return oldDelegate.ink.strokes.length != ink.strokes.length || 
         oldDelegate.currentStrokePoints.length != currentStrokePoints.length;
}
```

#### 4. Enhanced Writing Tips with PyThaiNLP Integration
**Problem**: Generic writing tips not specific to character structure  
**Solution**: Leveraged existing `analyze_character_components` backend function
```dart
Future<String> _getCharacterSpecificTips(String character) async {
  try {
    final response = await http.post(
      Uri.parse('http://localhost:8000/analyze-character'),
      headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
      body: json.encode({'character': character}),
    );
    
    if (response.statusCode == 200) {
      final data = json.decode(response.body);
      return _buildTipsFromAnalysis(character, data);
    }
  } catch (e) {
    print("Failed to get PyThaiNLP analysis: $e");
  }
  return _getStaticCharacterTips(character);
}
```

#### 5. Visual Selection and UI Improvements
**Problem**: No clear indication of which word was currently selected  
**Solution**: Added visual selection indicators and improved navigation
```dart
// Visual selection with different styling
decoration: BoxDecoration(
  color: isSelected ? const Color(0xFF2D2D2D) : const Color(0xFF1A1A1A),
  borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(16),
  border: Border.all(
    color: isSelected 
        ? const Color(0xFF4ECCA3) 
        : const Color(0xFF4ECCA3).withValues(alpha: 0.3),
    width: isSelected ? 3 : 2,
  ),
  boxShadow: [
    BoxShadow(
      color: Colors.black.withValues(alpha: 0.3),
      blurRadius: isSelected ? 12 : 8,
      offset: const Offset(0, 4),
    ),
  ],
),
```

#### 6. Simplified Navigation Interface
**Problem**: Redundant page indicators when scrollbar provides same functionality  
**Solution**: Removed page indicator dots and streamlined interface
```dart
// REMOVED: Page indicators (replaced with scrollbar)
// Page indicators
if (_currentWordMapping.length > 1) ...[
  Row(
    mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
    children: List.generate(/* page dots */),
  ),
],
```

## Character Tracing Implementation Summary - Phase 3

### Implementation Session Overview
**Date**: 2025-06-30  
**Feature**: Live Drawing Bug Fix and Flutter CustomPaint Troubleshooting  
**Primary Goal**: Resolve critical issue where live strokes weren't appearing during character tracing

### Root Cause Analysis

#### The Problem
Touch events were being registered correctly, but no live strokes appeared on the canvas during drawing. Strokes only appeared after completing the entire character, defeating the purpose of real-time visual feedback.

#### Investigation Process
1. **Web Research**: Used WebSearch to find Flutter CustomPaint live drawing issues and best practices
2. **Documentation Review**: Referenced Flutter docs for CustomPaint, CustomPainter, and setState patterns
3. **Systematic Testing**: Created minimal test implementations to isolate the issue
4. **Data Flow Analysis**: Added comprehensive debug logging to track touch events through the painting system

#### Key Findings
- **ML Kit Compatibility Issue**: Complex `mlkit.StrokePoint` objects don't render reliably with Flutter's painting system
- **Paint Configuration**: Need proper Paint style (PaintingStyle.stroke vs PaintingStyle.fill) 
- **setState Timing**: Critical to call setState() immediately in gesture handlers for live updates
- **shouldRepaint Logic**: Must return true when currentStrokePoints change for real-time rendering

### Technical Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Enhanced _InkPainter with Live Preview
**Problem**: Original painter only rendered completed strokes, not current drawing stroke  
**Solution**: Added `currentStrokePoints` parameter for real-time stroke preview
```dart
class _InkPainter extends CustomPainter {
  final mlkit.Ink ink;
  final List<mlkit.StrokePoint> currentStrokePoints;

  _InkPainter(this.ink, {this.currentStrokePoints = const []});

  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    final Paint paint = Paint()
      ..color = const Color(0xFF4ECCA3)
      ..strokeCap = StrokeCap.round
      ..strokeWidth = 4.0
      ..style = PaintingStyle.stroke; // Critical: stroke, not fill

    // Draw completed strokes
    for (final mlkit.Stroke stroke in ink.strokes) {
      final Path path = Path();
      bool first = true;
      for (final mlkit.StrokePoint point in stroke.points) {
        if (first) {
          path.moveTo(point.x, point.y);
          first = false;
        } else {
          path.lineTo(point.x, point.y);
        }
      }
      canvas.drawPath(path, paint);
    }

    // Draw current stroke being drawn (real-time preview)
    if (currentStrokePoints.isNotEmpty) {
      final Paint currentPaint = Paint()
        ..color = const Color(0xFF4ECCA3).withValues(alpha: 0.8)
        ..strokeCap = StrokeCap.round
        ..strokeWidth = 4.0
        ..style = PaintingStyle.stroke;

      final Path currentPath = Path();
      bool first = true;
      for (final mlkit.StrokePoint point in currentStrokePoints) {
        if (first) {
          currentPath.moveTo(point.x, point.y);
          first = false;
        } else {
          currentPath.lineTo(point.x, point.y);
        }
      }
      canvas.drawPath(currentPath, currentPaint);
    }
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(covariant _InkPainter oldDelegate) {
    // Always repaint if we're currently drawing
    if (currentStrokePoints.isNotEmpty || oldDelegate.currentStrokePoints.isNotEmpty) {
      return true; // Fast path for live drawing
    }
    // Repaint when ink changes
    return oldDelegate.ink.strokes.length != ink.strokes.length;
  }
}
```

#### 2. Optimized Gesture Handlers
**Problem**: Missing setState() calls and improper timing in pan handlers  
**Solution**: Streamlined gesture handling with immediate setState() calls
```dart
void _onPanStart(DragStartDetails details) {
  _currentStroke = mlkit.Stroke();
  _currentStrokePoints.clear();
  _strokeStartTime = DateTime.now();
  _currentStrokeCount++;
  
  final point = mlkit.StrokePoint(
    x: details.localPosition.dx,
    y: details.localPosition.dy,
    t: DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch,
  );
  
  _currentStroke!.points.add(point);
  _currentStrokePoints.add(point);
  
  _analyzeStrokeStart(details.localPosition);
  setState(() {}); // Critical: immediate redraw
  
  // Force immediate frame to ensure real-time rendering
  SchedulerBinding.instance.scheduleFrame();
}

void _onPanUpdate(DragUpdateDetails details) {
  if (_currentStroke != null) {
    final point = mlkit.StrokePoint(
      x: details.localPosition.dx,
      y: details.localPosition.dy,
      t: DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch,
    );
    
    _currentStroke!.points.add(point);
    _currentStrokePoints.add(point);
    
    setState(() {}); // Critical: trigger real-time redraw
  }
}

void _onPanEnd(DragEndDetails details) {
  if (_currentStroke != null) {
    _analyzeStrokeMetrics(_currentStroke!);
    _completedStrokes.add(_currentStroke!.points.toList());
    
    if (!_ink.strokes.contains(_currentStroke!)) {
      _ink.strokes.add(_currentStroke!);
    }
    
    _currentStroke = null;
    _currentStrokePoints.clear();
    
    _validateStrokeOrder();
    setState(() {});
  }
}
```

#### 3. Alternative Implementation Created
**Approach**: Created `_SimpleSignaturePainter` using Flutter docs pattern for comparison
```dart
class _SimpleSignaturePainter extends CustomPainter {
  final List<Offset?> points;
  
  _SimpleSignaturePainter(this.points);
  
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    final Paint paint = Paint()
      ..color = const Color(0xFF4ECCA3)
      ..strokeCap = StrokeCap.round
      ..strokeWidth = 4.0
      ..style = PaintingStyle.stroke;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < points.length - 1; i++) {
      if (points[i] != null && points[i + 1] != null) {
        canvas.drawLine(points[i]!, points[i + 1]!, paint);
      }
    }
  }
  
  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(_SimpleSignaturePainter oldDelegate) {
    return oldDelegate.points.length != points.length;
  }
}
```

#### 4. Hybrid Data Management
**Strategy**: Maintain both ML Kit data (for recognition) and simple points (for drawing)
```dart
// State variables for dual approach
List<mlkit.StrokePoint> _currentStrokePoints = []; // ML Kit data
List<Offset?> _simplePoints = []; // Simple drawing data

// Updated gesture handlers to maintain both
void _onPanUpdate(DragUpdateDetails details) {
  if (_currentStroke != null) {
    // ML Kit point for recognition
    final point = mlkit.StrokePoint(
      x: details.localPosition.dx,
      y: details.localPosition.dy,
      t: DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch,
    );
    
    _currentStroke!.points.add(point);
    _currentStrokePoints.add(point);
    
    // Simple point for drawing
    _simplePoints.add(Offset(details.localPosition.dx, details.localPosition.dy));
    
    setState(() {});
  }
}
```

### Troubleshooting Methodology

#### Phase 1: Comprehensive Debug Logging
Added extensive logging to track data flow from touch events to canvas painting:
- Touch coordinate tracking
- Paint configuration verification
- Canvas size and stroke point verification
- shouldRepaint call tracking

#### Phase 2: Minimal Test Implementation
Created simplified painter following Flutter documentation patterns to isolate whether the issue was with:
- CustomPaint/CustomPainter architecture
- ML Kit StrokePoint objects
- Paint configuration
- Widget lifecycle

#### Phase 3: Comparison Testing
Implemented both approaches side by side to verify:
- Real-time rendering capabilities
- Performance differences
- Data preservation for ML Kit recognition

#### Phase 4: Production Implementation
Applied the working solution while maintaining ML Kit integration for character recognition.

#### Phase 5: Code Cleanup
Removed all debug logging and finalized production-ready implementation.

### Key Learnings

#### Flutter CustomPaint Best Practices
1. **Paint Style Critical**: Must use `PaintingStyle.stroke` for line drawing, not `PaintingStyle.fill`
2. **setState() Timing**: Call immediately in gesture handlers for real-time updates
3. **shouldRepaint Logic**: Return `true` when any drawing state changes for live rendering
4. **SchedulerBinding**: Use `SchedulerBinding.instance.scheduleFrame()` to force immediate repaints

#### ML Kit Integration Patterns
1. **Data Compatibility**: Complex objects may not render reliably with Flutter painting
2. **Hybrid Approach**: Maintain both ML Kit data and simple drawing data when needed
3. **Performance**: Simple `Offset` lists perform better for real-time rendering than complex objects

#### Debugging Strategies
1. **Systematic Isolation**: Create minimal test cases to isolate specific issues
2. **Web Research**: Use documentation and community solutions for Flutter-specific problems
3. **Incremental Testing**: Apply fixes one at a time to verify each change
4. **Data Flow Tracking**: Log data transformation through the entire pipeline

### Files Modified

3. **Feedback System**: Visual indicators for correct/incorrect strokes
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Track rendering performance with large character sets

This Phase 3 implementation successfully resolved the critical live drawing issue and established robust patterns for Flutter CustomPaint with real-time user interaction.

## Character Tracing Shared Component Implementation - Phase 4

### Implementation Session Overview
**Date**: 2025-06-30  
**Feature**: Character Tracing Shared Component Architecture  
**Primary Goal**: Extract working functionality into reusable component and eliminate code duplication

### Problem Analysis

After Phase 3, we had working character tracing in the test widget but the dialogue overlay still had issues with live stroke rendering. The root cause was identified as code complexity and duplication - having two separate implementations meant bugs could exist in one but not the other.

### Solution: Shared Component Architecture

#### Design Principles
1. **Single Source of Truth**: One implementation used everywhere
2. **Modular Design**: Configurable component for different contexts
3. **Code Reusability**: Eliminate 90% of duplicate code
4. **Guaranteed Consistency**: Identical behavior across all usages

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Created Shared CharacterTracingWidget
**File**: `/Users/timwang/Projects/babblelon/lib/widgets/character_tracing_widget.dart`

**Key Features**:
- **Configurable API**: Supports different contexts with options
- **Live Stroke Rendering**: Real-time preview during drawing
- **PyThaiNLP Integration**: Character analysis and writing tips
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and layouts

**API Design**:
```dart
CharacterTracingWidget({
  required List<Map<String, dynamic>> wordMapping,
  VoidCallback? onBack,
  VoidCallback? onComplete,
  bool showBackButton = true,
  String? headerTitle,
  String? headerSubtitle,
  bool showWritingTips = true,
})
```

**Core Implementation**:
```dart
class _TracingPainter extends CustomPainter {
  final mlkit.Ink ink;
  final List<mlkit.StrokePoint> currentStrokePoints;

  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    // Draw completed strokes
    for (final mlkit.Stroke stroke in ink.strokes) {
      // ... stroke rendering
    }

    // Draw current stroke being drawn (real-time preview)
    if (currentStrokePoints.isNotEmpty) {
      final Paint currentPaint = Paint()
        ..color = const Color(0xFF4ECCA3).withValues(alpha: 0.8)
        ..strokeCap = StrokeCap.round
        ..strokeWidth = 4.0
        ..style = PaintingStyle.stroke;
      // ... real-time stroke rendering
    }
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(covariant _TracingPainter oldDelegate) {
    // Always repaint if we're currently drawing
    if (currentStrokePoints.isNotEmpty || oldDelegate.currentStrokePoints.isNotEmpty) {
      return true;
    }
    return oldDelegate.ink.strokes.length != ink.strokes.length;
  }
}
```

#### 2. Simplified Dialogue Overlay Implementation
**Before**: 273+ lines of complex, broken tracing code  
**After**: 20 lines using shared component

```dart
Widget _buildCharacterTracingDialog(Map<String, dynamic> itemData, String targetLanguage) {
  final wordMapping = List<Map<String, dynamic>>.from(itemData['word_mapping'] ?? [itemData]);
  
  return Dialog(
    backgroundColor: Colors.transparent,
    insetPadding: const EdgeInsets.all(20),
    child: CharacterTracingWidget(
      wordMapping: wordMapping,
      onBack: () {
        Navigator.of(context).pop();
        _showEnglishToTargetLanguageTranslationDialog(context, targetLanguage: 'th', initialTabIndex: 1);
      },
      onComplete: () => _submitTracing(itemData, targetLanguage),
      showBackButton: true,
      showWritingTips: true,
    ),
  );
}
```

#### 3. Refactored Test Widget
**Before**: 656 lines of duplicate implementation  
**After**: 46 lines using shared component

```dart
class _CharacterTracingTestWidgetState extends State<CharacterTracingTestWidget> {
  final List<Map<String, dynamic>> _testWordMapping = [
    {
      "thai": "เครื่องปรุง",
      "transliteration": "khreuang prung", 
      "translation": "seasoning; condiment",
      "audio_path": "assets/audio/npc_vocabulary_somchai/condiment_set.wav"
    }
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Dialog(
      backgroundColor: Colors.transparent,
      insetPadding: const EdgeInsets.all(20),
      child: CharacterTracingWidget(
        wordMapping: _testWordMapping,
        onBack: () => Navigator.of(context).pop(),
        onComplete: () {
          ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
            const SnackBar(
              content: Text('Character tracing test completed!'),
              backgroundColor: Color(0xFF4ECCA3),
            ),
          );
        },
        showBackButton: true,
        showWritingTips: true,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Quality Assurance

#### Testing Strategy
1. **Component Testing**: Shared component works in isolation
2. **Integration Testing**: Both contexts (dialogue, test) function identically
3. **Regression Testing**: All existing functionality preserved
4. **UI Consistency**: Identical appearance in both contexts

#### Validation Checks
✅ **Live Stroke Rendering**: Works immediately in both contexts  
✅ **Character Navigation**: Horizontal scrolling and selection  
✅ **Writing Tips**: PyThaiNLP integration functional  
✅ **Audio Playback**: Vocabulary audio works when available  
✅ **Back Navigation**: Proper context-aware navigation  
✅ **Completion Callbacks**: Item submission and test completion  

### Future Extensibility

The shared component architecture enables:
1. **Easy Addition**: New tracing contexts can be added with minimal code
2. **Feature Enhancement**: New features benefit all contexts automatically
3. **Bug Fixes**: Fixes in shared component resolve issues everywhere
4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimizations apply to all usages
5. **UI Consistency**: Design changes maintain consistency across contexts

### Outcomes

#### Immediate Benefits
✅ **Live Stroke Rendering**: Dialogue overlay now has working real-time strokes  
✅ **Code Deduplication**: 92-93% reduction in duplicate code  
✅ **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for character tracing
