// This file is kept for potential future dialogue-specific providers.
// Most current dialogue functionality uses providers from game_providers.dart
// and is handled directly in dialogue_overlay.dart.
//
// Previously contained DialogueData and DialogueState which were unused
// and have been removed to clean up the codebase.
