# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Thai Transliteration and Grammar Highlighting
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the system for displaying Thai text with optional Romanized transliteration and color-coded grammar highlighting to aid language learning.
# Details:
1. Research and implement Thai transliteration system (RTGS or phonetic)
2. Create toggle functionality for transliteration display
3. Implement part-of-speech tagging for Thai text
4. Design color coding system for different parts of speech
5. Create grammar highlighting renderer for dialogue text
6. Implement user preferences for display options (always on, on tap, off)
7. Add tooltip functionality for grammar explanations
8. Ensure proper rendering of Thai script, transliteration, and English subtitles
9. Optimize text layout for different screen sizes
10. Implement accessibility considerations for color-blind users
11. Create settings UI for customizing the display options

# Test Strategy:
Test transliteration accuracy with various Thai phrases. Verify part-of-speech tagging and color coding works correctly. Test toggle functionality for different display options. Ensure text is readable on different screen sizes. Test accessibility features for color-blind users. Verify performance with long dialogue texts. Conduct user testing to evaluate learning effectiveness of the grammar highlighting system.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Thai Transliteration System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Research and implement a Thai transliteration system that converts Thai script to Roman characters following either the Royal Thai General System (RTGS) or a phonetic approach.
### Details:
Create a transliteration service that takes Thai text as input and returns Romanized text. Implement mapping functions for Thai characters to their Roman equivalents, handling tone marks, vowels, and consonants correctly. Consider using existing libraries like 'thai-transliteration' as a starting point, but ensure accuracy for language learning purposes.

## 2. Develop Part-of-Speech Tagging for Thai Text [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a system to analyze Thai text and tag each word with its grammatical part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) to enable grammar highlighting.
### Details:
Research and integrate a Thai NLP library or API that provides part-of-speech tagging. If using an external service, implement caching to improve performance. Create a data structure that preserves the original text while attaching POS metadata to each word or phrase. Consider edge cases in Thai grammar where words can serve multiple functions.

## 3. Design Grammar Highlighting Renderer [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Create a rendering system that displays Thai text with color-coded highlighting based on parts of speech and grammatical elements.
### Details:
Design a color scheme for different parts of speech that is visually distinct but harmonious. Implement a renderer that can take tagged Thai text and apply appropriate styling. Ensure the system handles inline styling without breaking Thai character rendering. Include tooltip functionality that shows grammatical explanations when users tap on highlighted words.

## 4. Implement Display Toggle and User Preferences [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.3
### Description: Create functionality that allows users to toggle between different display modes (Thai only, Thai with transliteration, with/without highlighting) and save these preferences.
### Details:
Implement a settings interface for display options including: transliteration visibility (always on, on tap, off), grammar highlighting (on/off), and color scheme selection. Create a preferences service to store and retrieve user settings. Implement toggle controls that can be accessed from the main reading interface. Include accessibility options for color-blind users with alternative highlighting methods.

## 5. Optimize Text Layout and Rendering [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.3, 10.4
### Description: Ensure proper rendering and layout of Thai text, transliteration, and grammar highlighting across different screen sizes and devices.
### Details:
Implement responsive layout that properly displays Thai text with optional transliteration above or below. Optimize text rendering to handle the combined display of Thai script, Roman transliteration, and English translations when needed. Ensure proper line breaks and text flow for Thai language. Test and optimize performance, especially when displaying long passages with full highlighting and transliteration.
