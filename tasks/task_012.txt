# Test Strategy:
Run automated tests to verify ≥80% code coverage. Conduct performance testing on target devices to ensure smooth gameplay. Test memory usage during extended play sessions. Verify analytics events are properly tracked. Test TestFlight build distribution. Conduct user acceptance testing with a small group of testers. Verify App Store assets meet requirements. Test crash reporting system.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Testing Framework and Unit Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a comprehensive testing framework and implement unit tests for core game logic and widget functionality to achieve at least 80% code coverage.
### Details:
Use XCTest framework to create unit tests for game logic, scoring system, and widget functionality. Create mock objects for dependencies. Focus on critical paths first, then expand to edge cases. Set up CI integration for automated test runs.

## 2. Performance Optimization and Analytics Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Optimize game rendering, asset loading, and memory usage. Implement analytics tracking for key user metrics and crash reporting.
### Details:
Profile the app using Instruments to identify performance bottlenecks. Implement asset caching, texture compression, and memory management improvements. Integrate Firebase Analytics or similar to track user engagement metrics (session length, feature usage, retention). Set up crash reporting with Crashlytics or similar service.

## 3. App Store Assets and Metadata Preparation [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2
### Description: Create all required App Store assets including screenshots, preview video, app description, keywords, and privacy policy.
### Details:
Design and capture App Store screenshots for different device sizes (minimum 3 screenshots per device). Create a 30-second preview video showcasing key features. Write compelling app description with feature highlights. Research and select optimal keywords for discoverability. Draft privacy policy document covering data collection practices.

## 4. TestFlight Build and Distribution Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Create and distribute a TestFlight build for beta testing. Implement privacy labels and finalize App Store compliance requirements.
### Details:
Configure App Store Connect for the application. Create a production-ready build with appropriate versioning. Set up TestFlight distribution groups for internal and external testers. Complete App Privacy questionnaire and implement required privacy labels. Ensure all App Store guidelines are met including accessibility requirements.

## 5. Final QA and Marketing Preparation [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.4
### Description: Conduct final quality assurance testing across target devices. Create marketing materials and landing page. Document known issues and future roadmap.
### Details:
Perform systematic testing on all supported iOS devices and versions. Create 5 short promotional videos for TikTok/Instagram. Develop a simple landing page with app information and download link. Document any known issues with workarounds and prioritize for future updates. Create a roadmap for future feature development and improvements.
