# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Infrastructure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository, configure CI/CD, and set up the core development environment with Flutter, Flame, FlutterFlow, and Supabase.
# Details:
1. Create a new Git repository for the project
2. Set up basic CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
3. Initialize Flutter project with Flame engine integration
4. Create FlutterFlow project for no-code UI screens
5. Set up Supabase project for authentication, database, and storage
6. Configure FastAPI backend project on Fly.io
7. Link all components together with proper environment variables
8. Document the setup process for future reference
9. Create development, staging, and production environments
10. Set up project board for task tracking

# Test Strategy:
Verify all components can communicate with each other by creating simple test endpoints and UI elements. Ensure CI/CD pipeline successfully builds and deploys the application. Test authentication flow with Supabase. Confirm Flutter-Flame and FlutterFlow projects can be built and run locally.
