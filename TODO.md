## 🔒 SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

### Current Focus: Beta Launch Security
We're implementing essential security measures for beta testing while preserving full game access for testers.

### Immediate Security (In Progress)
- [ ] Secure FastAPI endpoints with JWT authentication
- [ ] Configure proper CORS for production domains  
- [ ] Move API keys to environment variables
- [ ] Add basic input validation and request sanitization
- [ ] Implement basic file upload validation (audio files)
- [ ] Add basic error handling and request logging
- [ ] Ensure Supabase RLS is properly configured

### Post-Beta Security Features (Future Implementation)

#### API Abuse Prevention
- [ ] Advanced rate limiting based on beta usage patterns
- [ ] Device fingerprinting and trial reset prevention
- [ ] Geographic restrictions if needed
- [ ] Cost management and auto-scaling controls
- [ ] Monthly API usage limits and alerts

#### Progressive Authentication System
- [ ] Trial limits (50-100 API calls) for anonymous users
- [ ] Soft authentication prompts at 70% trial usage
- [ ] Hard authentication gate at trial completion
- [ ] Account creation flow with immediate premium upgrade option

#### Advanced Monitoring & Analytics
- [ ] Usage analytics dashboard
- [ ] Anomaly detection systems
- [ ] Advanced logging and alerting
- [ ] Cost tracking and optimization
- [ ] User behavior analysis for conversion optimization

#### Fraud Detection & Prevention
- [ ] Multiple trial prevention (device + network fingerprinting)
- [ ] Automated abuse detection algorithms
- [ ] Suspicious activity flagging and blocking
- [ ] Advanced session validation

#### Premium Feature Gates
- [ ] Free tier: 1-2 complete levels
- [ ] Premium tier: Unlimited gameplay
- [ ] Advanced pronunciation analytics (premium)
- [ ] Extended vocabulary sets (premium)
- [ ] Premium NPCs and storylines

#### Cost Management Systems
- [ ] Priority queuing: paid users > trial users during high load
- [ ] Graceful degradation with cached responses
- [ ] Auto-scaling controls to prevent cost spikes
- [ ] Emergency API usage cutoffs

### Beta Testing Strategy
For beta launch, users get:
- **Full game access** - no artificial limitations
- **Complete level progression** - test entire game loop  
- **All features unlocked** - gather comprehensive feedback
- **Usage monitoring** - track patterns to inform production limits

### Security Notes
- Focus on security and stability for beta, not restrictions
- Collect usage data to set appropriate production limits
- Post-beta features should be implemented based on real usage patterns
- Priority is protecting APIs and user data, not preventing overuse during testing
